# Session Summary - 2026-01-26

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Properties Panel Implementation ✅
- Created `src/ui/widgets/properties_panel.py` - Tekla-style properties display
- Groups: General, Section, Material, Geometry, Attributes
- Connected to `selection_changed` signal
- Updates automatically when elements selected

### 2. Agent Team Structure Finalized ✅
- **Boss** (Manager): User interface, orchestration, progress tracking
- **Architect** (Planner): Feature planning, task decomposition (NO coding)
- **Coder** (Developer): Implementation, bug fixes
- **Researcher** (Analyst): Technical research, docs lookup
- Utility: Code Reviewer, Build Error Resolver, Refactor Cleaner, E2E Runner

### 3. Progress Tracking Protocol Established ✅
All agents now have instructions to update:
- `Phase5_Plan.md` - After task completion
- `knowledge/LEARNED.md` - New patterns discovered
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Structure changes

### 4. Documentation Created/Updated
- `agents/TEAM_OVERVIEW.md` - Complete team structure
- `agents/schmekla-boss.md` - Enhanced with tracking protocol
- `agents/schmekla-architect.md` - Fixed role (planner, not coder)
- `agents/schmekla-coder.md` - Added tracking protocol
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design, ADRs, signal flows
